Notes

Extraction was done heuristically:

Paragraphs styled as code or matching Nim/CLI/C patterns were included.

Command-line examples are grouped alongside Nim examples.

Some snippets may contain formatting artifacts (extra blank lines).

If you want snippets merged into a single file per chapter or renamed by topic, you can request a regenerated package.
